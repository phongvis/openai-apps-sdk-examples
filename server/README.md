# Radar Lite MCP server (Python)

This directory packages a Python implementation of the Radar Lite demo server using the `FastMCP` helper from the official Model Context Protocol SDK. It exposes the Radar Lite security analysis widget as both a resource and a tool so ChatGPT can render the UI inline.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A virtual environment (recommended)

## Installation

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Heads up:** There is a similarly named package named `modelcontextprotocol`
> on PyPI that is unrelated to the official MCP SDK. The requirements file
> installs the official `mcp` distribution with its FastAPI extra so that the
> `mcp.server.fastmcp` module is available. If you previously installed the
> other project, run `pip uninstall modelcontextprotocol` before reinstalling
> the requirements.

## Run the server

```bash
python main.py
```

This boots a FastAPI app with uvicorn on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (equivalently `uvicorn server.main:app --port 8000`). The endpoints mirror the Node demo:

- `GET /mcp` exposes the SSE stream.
- `POST /mcp/messages?sessionId=...` accepts follow-up messages for an active session.

Cross-origin requests are allowed so you can drive the server from local tooling or the MCP Inspector. Each tool returns structured content that echoes the analyzed query plus metadata that points to the Radar Lite widget shell.

## Next steps

Use these handlers as a starting point when wiring in real data, authentication, or localization support. The structure demonstrates how to:

1. Register reusable UI resources that load static HTML bundles.
2. Associate tools with those widgets via `_meta.openai/outputTemplate`.
3. Ship structured JSON (the requested query and downstream API response) alongside human-readable confirmation text.
